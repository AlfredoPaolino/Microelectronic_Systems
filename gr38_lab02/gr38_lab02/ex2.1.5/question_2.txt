By compiling with the new constraint of 0.65 on critical path, we obtain a different result in the timing report. In fact, it shows that now the critical path doesn't go through the chain of G blocks starting from the rightmost down to the C20. But instead, with this new constraint the critical path traverses the 15th column down to C20. Therefore, the difference resides in the path followed in the sparse tree.
