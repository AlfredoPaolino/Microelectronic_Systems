Critical path:
- bit 0 XOR
- First PG+G block for subtraction implementation
- G1 (block of carry 1)
- G3 (block of carry 3)
- G7 (block of carry 7)
- G11 (block of carry 11)
- G15 (block of carry 15)
- G27 (block of carry 27)
- Within the Carry Select Box it goes through:
	- MUX21 which selects the output of the RCA (with Carry In at '0' or '1')
- The critical path ends at S[31] with a delay of 0.81 ns
	(This delay is the same from S[31] to S[22], considering the 10 worst critical paths,
	 since they are the bits which need to go through the last level of G blocks in the
	 carry tree generator)
