The synthesizer obtained a lower delay by adding to the circuit several buffers. Some of them are buffers taken directly from the components library when the signal is needed as input. Others are a cascade of 2 inverters when an output signal is shared among multiple inputs of different blocks: the first inverter is put soon after the output signal generation, then it is branched to feed all blocks that need it as input, and just before becoming the inpute of the successive block another inverter is placed.
This solution is used to reduce the parassitic capacintance seen by the output of a block which needs to feed several other blocks (fan-out issue). If the parassitic capacitance is reduced, the time constant of the circuit reduces as well and it is able to work faster.
