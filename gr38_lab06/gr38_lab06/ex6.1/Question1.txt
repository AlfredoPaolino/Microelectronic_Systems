Since the question is ambiguos, we hereby provide two answers:

1) If for "rectangle" it's intended the bottom window then it contains the geometrical and technological parameters in order for the foundry to produce the chip.
2) If for "rectangle" it's intended the all die, then it represents the physical layout of the analyzed circuit
