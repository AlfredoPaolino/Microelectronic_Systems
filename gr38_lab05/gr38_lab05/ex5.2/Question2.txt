The nandHScharLoad.sp netlist provides a transient analysis with sweep command to repeat
	the analysis in precence of different load conditions.

As clearly shown by the plots, the higher the load capacitance the higher the current
	spikes needed to charge or discharge it. As a direct consequence, the area under the
	current curve is also bigger for bigger capacitances values, this because they
	hold overall more charges.
By the current convention used in Eldo (active sign convention), and by the orientation
	of the voltage generators in the netlist (refer to gate sketch in ex5.1 folder),
	the current flowing from Vdd is always negative, the one flowing to ground is always
	positive, meanwhile the load current is negative or positive whenever the load itself
	is being discharged or charged respectively.
The currents plot can be found in file waveform_currents_5_2.jpg.

Moreover, it is worth mentioning that as the load capacitance increases, the response of
	the gate slows down, since it directly affect the timing constant of the  circuit.
Also this behavior is evident in the plot, which can be found in waveform_voltages_5_2.jpg.
