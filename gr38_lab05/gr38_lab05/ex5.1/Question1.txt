The .measure instruction is a SPICE fuctionality which allows to measure the quantities
	of interest in a rigorous way, since using cursors provided in the Eldo's GUI
	environment lack of precision and placing them is a very time consuming task.
The measurement is started in the point indicated by the TRIG instruction (followed by the
	measure of interest together with the value of intereset and the RISE/FALL property), and it ends at the point
	indicated by the TARG instruction (always given measure, value, RISE/FALL property of interest).
Each measure is characterized by a label, which will be used to store the computed measurement
	within the .chi file containing the SPICE simulation results.
