Question 1
- In the design without constraints only the 'clock-to-out' delay is considered (0.09ns)
	which is clearly wrong since we are in presence of a sequential circuit.
- In the clock-constrained design the combinatinal circuits between to registers are also
	considered in the critical path. Moreover, the timing analysis is performed by
	taking into account the provided clock period. The components' setup time is also
	considered and added to the critical path. In conclusion, the critical path is
	subtracted from the clock period in order to obain the slack.

Question 2
- The combinational paths outside the registers (i.e. not placed between two registers)
	are not yet included within the set constraints. That being said, they might not
	respect the clock period timing and so they need to be constrained as well.
	Since these paths are purely combinational they can be constrained by means of
	a maximum delay constraint in Design Vision.
