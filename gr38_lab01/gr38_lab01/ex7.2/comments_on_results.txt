1) No further comments needed.
2) The files on simulation/synthesis directory differs because timings are removed during synthesis phase. This was done for each entity involved in the requirements.
3) We tested both active HIGH and active low reset signal and it turned out that the latter is 20% more power efficient than the former approach. Nonetheless, the latter shows 10% less area impact. 
4) We synthetized both asynchronous and synchronous configurations noticing that the result was always an asynchronous Flip-flop mapped on DFFR_X1 component of "Nangate" library.
5) In the RCA timing report, we can see a difference of 1ns delay between behavioral and structural description.
6) We uniformed the ENABLE convention, using active low for all the entities described thereafter. Furthermore, we created a bash script to automate the compilation process.
7) We used the tcl script to automate synthesis and generate report files.
